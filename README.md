# üöó Car Product Analysis

## üìå Overview
This project explores a dataset of 100,000 car listings to uncover insights into pricing, mileage trends, brand performance, and condition-based valuation. Using Python, SQL, and machine learning, the goal is to build a predictive model and deliver interactive dashboards for business decision-making in the automobile resale domain.

## üîç Key Insights

- **Price vs. Mileage:** Older cars with higher mileage show predictable depreciation.
- **Brand Analysis:** Premium brands maintain higher resale value across years.
- **Condition Impact:** "New" cars command significantly higher prices than "Used."
- **Model Performance:** Regression model predicts car prices with high accuracy.
- **Deployment:** Streamlit app allows users to input car attributes and receive price predictions.
